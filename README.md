## Overview

* Name : SSD1306_OLED_RPI
* Description :

0. Library to support the I2C  OLED Display Module
   driven by the SSD1306 controller for the Raspberry PI PICO rp2040
1. Invert color, rotate, sleep, scroll and contrast control.
2. 10 fonts included.
3. Graphics class included.
4. Bitmaps supported.
5. Can support both I2C ports. IC20 or IC21 selected by user.
6. Tested on 128X64 & 128X32 display size. Should work for 96X16 display size.
7. Polymorphic print class included to print many data types.

* Author: Gavin Lyons

* Developed on Toolchain:
	1. Raspberry pi PICO RP2040
	2. SDK(1.4.0) C++20
	3. compiler G++ for arm-none-eabi((15:10.3-2021.07-4) 
	4. CMAKE(VERSION 3.12) , VScode(1.84.2)
	5. Linux Mint 21.2
	
## Test

There are 8 example files included. User picks the one they want 
by editing the CMakeLists.txt :: add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}  section.
There are 8 paths , comment in one path and one path only.

| Filename | File Function | Screen Size |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| HELLO | Basic use case | 128x64 |
| HELLO_128_32 | Basic use case  | 128x32 |
| BITMAP  | Shows use of bitmaps | 128x64 |
| CLOCK_DEMO | A basic clock Demo | 128x64 |
| FUNCTIONS |Test OLED functionality: scroll, rotate etc | 128x64 |
| SPEED_TEST | Frame rate per second test | 128x64 |
| TEXT |Tests Text & fonts  | 128x64 |
| GRAPHICS | Tests graphics  | 128x64 |

## Software

### API

The API (application programming interface) documentation is at link hosted on github pages and generated by Doxygen software.
Lots of information on the software.

[ API URL Link](https://gavinlyonsrepo.github.io/misc/software_docs/SSD1306_OLED_PICO/index.html) 

### I2C

Hardware I2C.

1. I2C Address is set by default to  0x3C(your module could be different, 
	user can change argument passed into "OLEDbegin" method).

2. Can support both I2C ports. IC20 or IC21 selected by user.

3. I2C Clock rate can be a passed into in the "OLEDbegin" method as a argument in Kilo hertz.

| Frame rate per second example file results  | I2C clock rate KiloHetrz |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | 100 |
| 12 | 400 |

4. The user must also specify the data and clk lines which are linked to the interface used

In all the examples the I2C is set up for ::
Address 0x3C , Interface I2C1 , Clock speed 100Khz, Data pin GPIO 18, Clock pin GPIO 19 .
 
### Fonts

There are 10 fonts packaged with library. Fonts can be easily added or removed by user.
All the Font data is in file SSD1306_OLED_font.cpp and SSD1306_OLED_font.hpp

Font data table: 

| num | Font pointer name | character size XxY |  ASCII range | Size in bytes |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |  ------ | 
| 1 | pFontDefault | 6x8 |  0 - 0xFE, Full Extended  | 1534 |
| 2 | pFontWide | 9x8 | 0x20 - 0x5A, NO lowercase letters | 535 |
| 3 | pFontPico | 4x6 | 0x20 - 0x7E  | 289 | 
| 4 | pFontSinclairS  | 8x8 | 0x20 - 0x7E | 764 |
| 5 | pFontMega | 16x16 | 0x20 - 0x7E | 3044 |
| 6 | pFontArialBold  | 16x16 | 0x20 - 0x7E |  3044 |
| 7 | pFontHallfetica | 16x16 | 0x20 - 0x7E | 3044 |
| 8 | pFontArialRound| 16x24 | 0x20 - 0x7E | 4564 |
| 9 | pFontGroTesk | 16x32 | 0x20 - 0x7A |  5828 |
| 10 | pFontSixteenSeg | 32x48 | 0x2D-0x3A , 0-10  :  .  / - only | 2692 |

Font size in bytes = ((X * (Y/8)) * numberOfCharacters) + ControlBytes

**Remove a font**

To remove an unwanted font from project simply comment out or delete.

1. The Font data in  SSD1306_OLED_font.cpp file
2. The pointer to font at bottom of SSD1306_OLED_font.cpp file
3. The associated extern pointer declaration in the SSD1306_OLED_font.hpp file

**Adding a new font**

1. Add the Font data in  SSD1306_OLED_font.cpp file
2. Add a pointer to font at bottom of SSD1306_OLED_font.cpp file
3. Add an associated extern pointer declaration in the SSD1306_OLED_font.hpp file

The new ASCII font must have following font structure.
First 4 bytes are control bytes followed by vertically addressed font data.

```
// An 8 by 8 character size font starting at 
// ASCII offset 0x20 in ASCII table with 0x5F characters in font. 
static const uint8_t FontExample[] =
{
0x08, 0x08, 0x20, 0x5f,   // x-size, y-size, offset, total characters
(data)
}
```

Some of the fonts packaged with library came from [URL](http://rinkydinkelectronics.com/).
If you have picture of font like so.

There is a monochrome font maker there at [URL](http://rinkydinkelectronics.com/t_make_font_file_mono.php) 


### Bitmaps

Two different bitmaps methods can be used.

| num | Method name | data addressing | Notes | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |   
| 1 | OLEDBitmap() |horizontal| Draws bitmaps to the buffer | 
| 2 | OLEDBuffer() |vertical | Write a full screen bitmap direct to screen, used internally| 

Bitmaps can be turned to data [here at link]( https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/) 
See example file "BITMAP" for more details.
